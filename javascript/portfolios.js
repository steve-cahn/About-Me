				"<p>This is an eCommerce mockup website I built which sells phones</p><p>It took me a bit longer than a month to create it. I wasn't working on it full time due to my other responsibilities (such as my temporary job).</p><p>I used HTML5, sass, and JavaScript in vscode to create this website.</p><p>I definitely did learn a lot from creating this website, and got a lot more comfortable coding. The two biggest challenges, were:</p><ul><li>Figuring out a way to filter the products.</li><li>â€¢	I totally forgot that when copying JavaScript objects, they copy as shallow copies, and not deep copies. When I tried updating the cart, there was this weird bug which I couldn't seem to figure out, until I remembered I had to create a deep copy on the object.</li></ul><p>All in all, it was very fun and a bit challenging creating such a website.</p>"
