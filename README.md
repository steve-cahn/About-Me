<h2>Creating my "About Me" website</h2>

This site took me a while to create. I worked on it using all my free time while I had a full-time job. It was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot from it.

I created three versions of this website.

I started out without a design in mind. I looked at a ton of "About" websites, and tried getting an idea of how it's supposed to look. The first version came out like this:

*Yeah... cringy.*

I then attempted to use a Material-UI theme. I basically had to re-create the website.

That was a lot better than the first one, but I still wasn't getting that professional look. There were too many colors there, it was very cluttered, and my social media profile links weren't listed. I wasn't happy with that look, so I re-created the website, yet a third time:

**Finally,** a professional, clean, website with a modern look! There is just one primary color. There's a perfect amount of white spaces. So much better. Third time's a charm!
